## Stock Management & Billing Application

This stock management system is a software designed to manage inventory and produce receipts. It is written in Python and utilizes major libraries such as abc, unittest, and os. The system reads in a CSV file of items and their details and converts it to a list. The application has six functions, which include adding, editing, and deleting item details such as name, category, perishable, stock, and sell price. It also has a full stock list, which displays all available items and their details.

Additionally, the system can create a receipt and purchase stock, updating the stock list. Users can search the application for completely matching name, category, sell price, and whether an item is perishable or not. The search function returns a list of all matches and their details.

One of the strengths of this system is that it is full user input, requiring no code to be ran. Every single function has multiple test cases, emphasizing good programming practices such as object orientation, unit testing, and exception handling. The code documentation and naming conventions are clear, making it easy for users to understand and navigate the application.

Overall, this stock management system is an excellent tool for businesses looking to manage their inventory efficiently. It is user-friendly and provides multiple functions to suit different inventory management needs. The system is well-designed, making it easy for users to modify and update their inventory as needed.

## Visualisation of Epidemic Data

* Project goal: Visualizing the impact of an airborne disease outbreak through simulations.
* Data: Results from simulations of the outbreak area modeled as a grid of cells, including cell population, infected count, and uncertainty statistics.
* Project objective: Creating interactive dashboards to visualize the uncertainty and impact of the outbreak for a single simulation and arbitrary number of simulations.
* Visualization tool: Power BI.
* Project outcome: Effective visualization of the outbreak impact and uncertainty.

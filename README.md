## Application of Learning Analytics to 'Massive Online Open Course' Data

 Content | Languages|Applications | Major Libraries 
:----------------|:--------------:| -----------|----------
|  __Project goal:__ Gain insights that could help course providers make improvements to the course content and delivery.<br><br>__Data:__ Cytological characteristics data from breast tissue samples.<br><br>__Objective:__ Utilize the **CRISP-DM** process to complete two cycles of data analysis, applying a wide range of skills learned from dplyr and ggplot2 to gain insights from the MOOC data set. Develop a comprehensive understanding of the data, analyze it, and derive insights that can improve the course content and delivery. Ensure that the project is reproducible by using Project Template and sharing the code and documentation.<br><br> __Outcome:__ A reprodcuible report providing strong insights into the MOOC dataset. | R |Rstudio <br><br>   Rmarkdown | ggplot2<br><br>dplyr<br><br>ProjectTemplate |



## Classification of Breast Tissue Samples using Statistical Methods

| Content | Languages|Applications | Major Libraries |
|:----------------|:--------------:| -----------|----------|
|  __Project goal:__ Developing classifiers for predicting cancer presence in breast tissue samples using cytological characteristics data.<br><br>__Data:__ Cytological characteristics data from breast tissue samples.<br><br>__Objective:__ Building classifiers using statistical methods such as logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and evaluating their performance through cross-validation.<br><br> __Outcome:__ The project successfully developed classifiers to predict breast cancer presence using statistical methods, and demonstrated the effectiveness of these methods in identifying predictors of cancer presence. <br><br> __Theoretical:__ A mathemcatical question relating to logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis was also answered. | R |Rstudio <br><br>   Rmarkdown | bestglm<br><br>glmnet<br><br>MASS |

| ---------------- |:----------------:|--------------|--------------|
|      __Project goal:__ An introduction to software engineering. Develop a user-friendly stock management system to efficiently manage inventory and produce receipts.<br><br>  __Data:__   The system reads in a CSV file of items and their details and converts it to a list.<br><br> __Features:__ Full user input, no need to run any code. Six functions available, including full stock list and creating receipts. Search function returns a list of matching items and their details. <br><br>__Programming practices:__ Emphasizes object orientation, unit testing, and exception handling. Clear code documentation and naming conventions. <br><br>__Outcome:__ An excellent tool for businesses to efficiently manage their inventory. Provides multiple functions to suit different inventory management needs. Well-designed and easy to modify/update inventory as needed.| Python |PyCharm |abc<br>Numpy<br>unittest<br>os
   

## Visualisation of Epidemic Data


| Content |  Applications|
|----------------|:--------------|
|   __Project goal:__ Visualizing the impact of an airborne disease outbreak through simulations.<br><br>__Data:__ Results from simulations of the outbreak area modeled as a grid of cells, including cell population, infected count, and uncertainty statistics.<br><br>__Objective:__ Creating interactive dashboards to visualize the uncertainty and impact of the outbreak for a single simulation and arbitrary number of simulations.<br><br> __Outcome:__ Effective visualization of the outbreak impact and uncertainty. Easily understandable for those not statistically literate.|PowerBI

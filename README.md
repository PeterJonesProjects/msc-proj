# msc-proj
A collection of projects undertaken in MSc Data Science (Statistics)

8/10 projects completed with the masters still ongoing

Each project below outlines the objective, methods used and a data set (if legally availbale to share)

## Stock Management & Billing Application

*__Project goal:__ Developing a stock management system software to efficiently manage inventory and produce receipts.

*__Data:__ The system reads in a CSV file of items and their details, which is then converted into a list. The system also allows users to add, edit, and delete item details, as well as search for items based on name, category, sell price, and perishability.

*__Project objective:__ Designing a user-friendly and functional stock management system in Python that emphasizes good programming practices, including object orientation, unit testing, and exception handling.

*__Project outcome:__ An efficient and well-designed stock management system that provides multiple functions to suit different inventory management needs. The system is user-friendly, allowing users to modify and update their inventory as needed without requiring any code to be run. The system also includes clear code documentation and naming conventions, making it easy for users to navigate and understand the application.

## Visualisation of Epidemic Data

* __Project goal:__ Visualizing the impact of an airborne disease outbreak through simulations.

* __Data:__ Results from simulations of the outbreak area modeled as a grid of cells, including cell population, infected count, and uncertainty statistics.

* __Project objective:__ Creating interactive dashboards to visualize the uncertainty and impact of the outbreak for a single simulation and arbitrary number of simulations.

* __Project outcome:__ Effective visualization of the outbreak impact and uncertainty.

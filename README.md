## Stock Management & Billing Application

* __Project goal:__ An introduction to software engineering. Develop a user-friendly stock management system to efficiently manage inventory and produce receipts.

* __Data:__ The system reads in a CSV file of items and their details and converts it to a list.

* __Features:__ Full user input, no need to run any code. Six functions available, including full stock list and creating receipts. Search function returns a list of matching items and their details.

* __Programming practices:__ Emphasizes object orientation, unit testing, and exception handling. Clear code documentation and naming conventions.

## Visualisation of Epidemic Data

* __Project goal:__ Visualizing the impact of an airborne disease outbreak through simulations.

* __Data:__ Results from simulations of the outbreak area modeled as a grid of cells, including cell population, infected count, and uncertainty statistics.

* __Project objective:__ Creating interactive dashboards to visualize the uncertainty and impact of the outbreak for a single simulation and arbitrary number of simulations.

* __Project outcome:__ Effective visualization of the outbreak impact and uncertainty. Easily understandable for those not statistically literate.

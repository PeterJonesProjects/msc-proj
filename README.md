# msc-DataScience-projects
A collection of projects undertaken in MSc Data Science (Statistics)

8/10 projects completed with the masters still ongoing

Each project below outlines the objective, methods used and a data set (if legally availbale to share)


## Classification of Breast Tissue Samples using Statistical Methods

* __Project goal:__ Developing classifiers for predicting cancer presence in breast tissue samples using cytological characteristics data.

* __Data:__ Cytological characteristics data from breast tissue samples.

* __Objective:__ Building classifiers using statistical methods such as logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and evaluating their performance through cross-validation.

* __Outcome:__ The project successfully developed classifiers to predict breast cancer presence using statistical methods, and demonstrated the effectiveness of these methods in identifying predictors of cancer presence. A mathemcatical question relating to logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis was also answered.

## Stock Management & Billing Application

* __Project goal:__ An introduction to software engineering. Develop a user-friendly stock management system to efficiently manage inventory and produce receipts.

* __Data:__ The system reads in a CSV file of items and their details and converts it to a list.

* __Features:__ Full user input, no need to run any code. Six functions available, including full stock list and creating receipts. Search function returns a list of matching items and their details.

* __Programming practices:__ Emphasizes object orientation, unit testing, and exception handling. Clear code documentation and naming conventions.

* __Outcome:__ An excellent tool for businesses to efficiently manage their inventory. Provides multiple functions to suit different inventory management needs. Well-designed and easy to modify/update inventory as needed.

## Visualisation of Epidemic Data

* __Project goal:__ Visualizing the impact of an airborne disease outbreak through simulations.

* __Data:__ Results from simulations of the outbreak area modeled as a grid of cells, including cell population, infected count, and uncertainty statistics.

* __Objective:__ Creating interactive dashboards to visualize the uncertainty and impact of the outbreak for a single simulation and arbitrary number of simulations.

* __Outcome:__ Effective visualization of the outbreak impact and uncertainty. Easily understandable for those not statistically literate.
